<h1>WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS</h1>

<div class="content-holder">
<h2>Four (4) reasons why you should stay in Las Vegas</h2>

     <div class="content">
      <h3>Weather</h3>
	  <p>The good news is that Las Vedas enjoys more than 310days of sunshine each year.East coasters and people from hot and humid climate appreciate lack of snow and humidity. And we only get about 4" of rain each year.</p><br><p>Winters are generally short and mild. Hot weather can last from June to September, although 3 months out of the year is extremely hot there while the other 9 months of the year are gorgeous. </p>
     </div>
	 
     <div class="content">
      <h3>No Natural Disasters</h3>
	  <p>You really can't boast this withous appearing intensive,but this is one of the best parts of living in Las Vegas. Next Hurricane season you will be safe because those storms will not reach Nevada. You will also steer clear of earthquakes and Tornadoes and there is no chance a Blizzard will keep you from going on your afternoon run.<br>You might deal with flooding from time to time and wind can be a nuisance, but you are free to talk about the lack of natural disasters because <b>Las Vegas</b> does not have any.</p>
     </div>
	 
     <div class="content">
      <h3>The Outdoor</h3>
	  <p>THE ADVENTURES</p>
	  <p>Just twenty minutes from the center of the town, red Rock Climbers. Nothing will make your friends jealous more than when they see you sporting that tan you got while learning how to belay.<br>Getting a bit outdoorsy is too easy when you are living in Las Vegas as you are surrounded by local hiking trails and plenty of opportunities to mountain bike. Seven National Parks are within a few hours'drive of Las Vegas making your new home the perfect base camp for exploration.</p>

     <div class="content">
      <h3>No State Income Tax</h3>
	  <p>You will be surprised at just how much you will save by not having to pay for state income taxes. Luckily, gaining revenue helps out Las Vegas locals in that regard. When life is relatively normal and not affected by global pandemics, nearly a billion dollars in gambling taxes and revenues is pumped into the local economy annually.</p><br><p>With all the money you save on taxes, you will be able to consider buying a home you are used to renting elsewhere. That will definately make your friends jealous when they realise you won 2,200 square foot house and pay less than their rent on that 500 square foot apartment.</p>
